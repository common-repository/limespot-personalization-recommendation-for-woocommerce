== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can LimeSpot help my business? =
Personalization is a proven tool to increase e-commerce sales. It brings the power of knowing your customer to the world of online retail. It means being able to show each individual shopper what they are most likely to be interested in based on their age, gender, interests, and preferences. Large-scale “enterprise” retailers such as Amazon and eBay already offer personalization by analyzing behavior on their sites.
Companies that invest in the analytical data that personalization can generate have 49% higher revenue growth and 30% higher ROI than those that don't, and surveys show that 40% of consumers buy more from retailers that personalize their shopping experience.

= What types of expertise do I need to use LimeSpot services? =
None! LimeSpot is designed to be a simple and seamless plug-and-play solution.

= How long does it take to set up a LimeSpot-powered store? =
Normally, it should not take more than 5 minutes to install LimeSpot in your store. You can, however, spend more time creating custom targeting rules that will improve personalization results and product recommendations.

= Will LimeSpot work on mobile phones? = 
Yes. LimeSpot U/I components are completely responsive. We also provide free theme customization in case of any incompatibility.
